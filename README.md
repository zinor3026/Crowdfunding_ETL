# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

## Description:
This is an ETL mini project. By completing this project, I was able to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. Four different csv files are created which can be found in the Resources folder. An ERD is created to connect those four csv files. The diagram, schema and the sql file can be found in the Starter_files folder along with the jupyter notebook. 
 ## Installations
 I used pandas and numpy for this project.
 ## Other Instructions:
 Every file can be found in the Starter_files folder.  Comments can be found above each code in jupyter notebook.

 ## Contributing
All the problems are solved with the help of the activities, Regular Expression HOWTO page and the codes used during previous classes. To debug the errors, I used stackoverflow and ChatGPT.
